    `I'm Oscar Chua Wei Wen, a full stack developer from
                    Malaysia. I build software both for fun and for a living.
                    I'm passionate about learning new technologies and
                    building things that make people's lives easier.`,
    `
                    I have been coding since 2021, and it all started when I
                    received my last year of university project from my mentor.
                    Later on, I got my first job and landed as a full stack
                    developer at Hatio Sea Sdn Bhd.

    `
                    Typescript, Java, Javascript are my primary language in my
                    career path, although I believe that I am capable of using
                    other languages as well, aside from PHP. Most of my time is
                    focusing on web applications, mobile applications, backend
                    applications. You can find my projects in my github repo.
